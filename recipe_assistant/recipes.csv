"i have been making indian pudding for ages, since i was 12 in fact. my first recipe, for the two years that i used it, came from yankee magazine and while it tasted good it was far too firm, nearly slice-able. ever since that first year i made indian pudding i have been the designated maker when in the country. i have used and tried many many recipes in 31 years and none really were what i was looking for. i wanted that soft consistency that did not whey when cooked. i have seen hundreds of recipes stating that it should whey (separate a bit) and i just do not like it. so i set out to do my own and in an easier way. most new englanders i know, though some do, would not dream of adding raisins, dried or fresh apples, nuts, eggs or tapioca though i have seen recipes with all of these and worse. this is heart warming, fragrant, a bit spicy and a pudding with that lovely soft consistency. can i give exact cooking times? no, sorry, but just as flour, all corn meal will take it's own time so i will work here with consistencies not times. this is an all stove top method and i made one last night while watching a tv program. i simply came out to the kitchen on the commercials to stir. the key is keeping the stove on low once it has been turned to low. we also love this for breakfast and would never serve with whipped cream. go anywhere in maine and you will get ice cream on it as it should be! this is a 'not too sweet' version as most use sugars and molasses and i do not. i have never had a lump in my pudding using this recipe. i have had indian pudding since i was 2, one bowl and i am in heaven i just know it. this looks like many steps though it really isn't and is a no fuss recipe. this is a good make ahead one too. enjoy!
